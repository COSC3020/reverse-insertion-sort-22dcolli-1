# Reverse Insertion Sort

Consider the code for insertion sort we covered in class:

```javascript
function insertionSort(arr) {
  for(var i = 1; i < arr.length; i++) {
    var val = arr[i];
    var j;
    for(j = i; j > 0 && arr[j-1] > val; j--) {
      arr[j] = arr[j-1];
    }
    arr[j] = val;
  }
  return arr;
}
```

Change this function such that it works from the end of the array rather than
the beginning, `insertionSortReverse()` -- only the direction of
iterating over the elements is reversed, the array is still sorted the same way
(ascending). Add your code in `code.js`. Test your new function; I've provided
some basic testing code that uses [jsverify](https://jsverify.github.io/) in
`code.test.js`.

## Average-Case Time Complexity of Insertion Sort

In the lectures, we covered that insertion sort has best-case time complexity of
$\Theta(n)$ and worst-case time complexity of $\Theta(n^2)$. What is the
average-case time complexity ($\Theta$)?

Hint: Think about what happens in each iteration of the loop, and how often the
loop is executed. Keep in mind that for asymptotic analysis we don't care about
constant factors.

Describe your reasoning and the conclusion you've come to. Your reasoning is
most important -- you can easily find the answer, but you need to demonstrate
that you've understood the concept. Add your answer to this markdown file.

## Plagarism Statement

All exercises must contain the following statement:
“I certify that I have listed all sources used to complete this exercise, including the use
of any Large Language Models. All of the work is my own, except where stated
otherwise. I am aware that plagiarism carries severe penalties and that if plagiarism is
suspected, charges may be filed against me without prior notice.”

Checked using my answer from last semester but attempted before checking.

## Answer:
The average time complexity is $\Theta(n^2)$, I believe this is correct after thinking about insertion sort and how it operates. In particular, the best case is with an already sorted input which would be $\Theta(n)$ because the algorithm goes through the outer loop and confirms it doesn't need to do anything extra. Otherwise, at the very least, the algorithm will at least go through both loops once(it could be more times, but if the input is not already sorted then it has to go through both loops at least once). This leaves us with the same complexity as the worst case $\Theta(n^2)$ as our average complexity.
